Python implementation of FINT

This is a Python implementation of FINT written for Python 3.x. The classes were kept close to the original C++ implementation. Their use is therefore not necessarily very pythonic. See example_main.py for usage examples.
Make sure that the folder with pyFINT is added to the path in order to make it available to your script.
